# Climate change and temperature anomalies 

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.


```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


There are two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select (Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, 
          Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, #columns 3 to 5
               names_to = "Month",
               values_to = "delta")

```

Inspect the dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


```{r}
glimpse(tidyweather)
```

```{r,scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(size = 0.8)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

 Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. 
 
```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(size = 0.6)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )+
  NULL

```


We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r,intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

glimpse(comparison)

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r,density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )+
  NULL

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r,averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

glimpse(average_annual_anomaly)


#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_delta = median(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            count_delta = n(),
            se_delta = sd_delta / sqrt(count_delta),
            ci_delta_up = mean_delta + qt(.975, count_delta-1)*se_delta ,
            ci_delta_dw = mean_delta - qt(.975, count_delta-1)*se_delta 
            )
            
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI
print(formula_ci)
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

set.seed(1)

#Calculate the CI for the relevant interval...
#2011 - present

boot_weather_1 <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps=100, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

percentile_ci_1<- boot_weather_1 %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
print(percentile_ci_1)



```


* The data clearly shows us what has consistently been advocated by climate scientists: that our earth is significantly warming, and that those changes really started taking off after the industrial revolution. We used scatter plots, density graphs and confidence intervals to dissect and present the NASA climate data. Going in to the data, especially when grouped by month and viewing the variance in the climate delta observed, we can see a clear trend towards hotter summers, which we have all experienced ourselves. The greater variance in the non-summer months is in line with the claims by climate change deniers that an abnormally cold winter refutes climate change. The density plot underlines that the changes to our global climate have been especially drastic in the last two decades, hinting at the possibility that we are now on an exponential growth trajectory in our worldwide temperatures.


# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data1", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```


We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

* Estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016:

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram


```{r}
temp_gss <- gss %>% 
   mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes",
    snapchat == "NA" | instagrm == "NA" ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
  ))
```

```{r}
prop_gss <- temp_gss %>% 
  filter(snap_insta != "NA") %>% 
  count(snap_insta) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

```


```{r}
temp_gss %>% 
  filter(snap_insta != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta = snap_insta == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_prop = mean(snap_insta),
            sd_prop = sd(snap_insta),
            count_prop = n(),
            se_prop = sd_prop / sqrt(count_prop),
            ci_prop_up = mean_prop + qt(.975, count_prop-1)*se_prop ,
            ci_prop_dw = mean_prop - qt(.975, count_prop-1)*se_prop 
            )
```
```{r}
glimpse(temp_gss)
glimpse(prop_gss)
```



## Twitter, by education level

* Estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
2. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
3. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
4. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
5. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?


```{r}
#Question 1 - Change 'degree' from character variable to factor variable. 
#Levels not sorted alphabetically... 

gss2 <- gss
gss2$degree[gss2$degree == "Lt high school"] <- '1'
gss2$degree[gss2$degree == "High school"] <- '2'
gss2$degree[gss2$degree == "Junior college"] <- '3'
gss2$degree[gss2$degree == "Bachelor"] <- '4'
gss2$degree[gss2$degree == "Graduate"] <- '5'

gss2$degree <- as_factor(gss2$degree)

head(gss2,5)
```


```{r}
#Question 2 - Create New Variable - 'bachelor_graduate' 
gss3 <- gss %>% 
   mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree == 'Bachelor' | degree == 'Graduate' ~ "*Yes*",
    degree == "NA" ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "*No*"
  ))

head(gss3,5)
```


```{r}
#Question 3 - Calculate the proportion of bachelor_graduate that do 
# and do not use twitter...
gss_twitter_prop <- gss3 %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "*Yes*") %>% 
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
  count(twitter) %>% 
  mutate(Proportion = n/sum(n) * 100) 

colnames(gss_twitter_prop) = c("Twitter", "Number", "Proportion [%]")
print(gss_twitter_prop)
```

```{r}
#Question 4 - Construct 95% CIs for the proportions of 
# bachelor_graduates that use twitter.

gss3 %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "*Yes*") %>% 
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
  mutate(twitter = twitter == "Yes") %>% 
  summarise(Mean_prop = mean(twitter),
            SD_prop = sd(twitter),
            Count_prop = n(),
            SE_prop = SD_prop / sqrt(Count_prop),
            Upper_CI_prop = Mean_prop + qt(.975, Count_prop-1)*SE_prop ,
            Lower_CI_prop = Mean_prop - qt(.975, Count_prop-1)*SE_prop 
            )

gss3 %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "*Yes*") %>% 
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
  mutate(twitter = twitter == "No") %>% 
  summarise(Mean_prop = mean(twitter),
            SD_prop = sd(twitter),
            Count_prop = n(),
            SE_prop = SD_prop / sqrt(Count_prop),
            Upper_CI_prop = Mean_prop + qt(.975, Count_prop-1)*SE_prop ,
            Lower_CI_prop = Mean_prop - qt(.975, Count_prop-1)*SE_prop 
            )

```

* Question 5: The Confidence Intervals for the proportions of bachelor and graduate students that do and do not use Twitter do NOT overlap. As a result of this, we can say with great confidence that a much larger proportion of bachelor/graduate students do not use twitter (when compared to those that do). 


## Email usage

* Estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
2. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amount of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
3. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
4. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.


```{r}
#Question 1 - New variable called email...
gss_email <- gss 

gss_email <- transform(gss_email, email = 
                         ifelse(gss_email$emailhr != "NA" | 
                                  gss_email$emailmin != "NA", 
                                (as.numeric(gss_email$emailmin) + 
                                   60*as.numeric(gss_email$emailhr)), "NA"))

head(gss_email,5)

```



```{r}
#Question 2 - Visualize this distribution and find the mean + median amount of time Americans spend on email...

gss_email2 <- gss_email %>% 
  filter(email != "NA")
  gss_email2$email <- as.numeric(gss_email2$email)

  
mean_email <- mean(gss_email2$email)
median_email <- median(gss_email2$email)
print(mean_email)
print(median_email)

gss_email2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(email)))+ 
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(min(as.numeric(gss_email2$email)), 
                              max(as.numeric(gss_email2$email)), 100)) +
  
  labs(title = "Weekly Email Usage for Americans", x = "Email Minutes",
       y = "Count (Frequency)") +
  NULL

```

* Question 2 continued... As we can see the distribution is very skewed to the right (positively skewed). Because of the way the arithmetic mean is calculated, large positive outliers (that are clearly present in this distribution) will produce a large, biased mean. In this instance, the median is probably a better "average value", because it is not distorted by (biased to) the large positive outliers. 


```{r, calculate_emailCI_using_bootstrap}

#Question 3 - Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly.
# Use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

set.seed(1234)

boot_gss <- gss_email2 %>%
  specify(response = email) %>% 
  generate(reps=100, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

email_ci_1 <- boot_gss %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

Hours = email_ci_1 %/% 60
Minutes = email_ci_1 %% 60

email_ci_humanized <- c(Hours[c(1)], Minutes[c(1)], Hours[c(2)], Minutes[c(2)] )
email_ci_humanized <- as.data.frame(email_ci_humanized)

colnames(email_ci_humanized) = c("Lower CI Hours", "Lower CI Minutes", 
                                 "Upper CI Hours", "Upper CI Minutes")
print(email_ci_humanized)

```

* This result seems fairly reasonable. The confidence interval perhaps seems fairly wide, given the large number of data points, but this caould be due to the fact that there is large variation in the data, and that large positive outlying values (of which there are a few), will introduce bias and largely affect the mean. 




Question 4 - Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning. 

* We would expect the 99% confidence interval to be wider than the 95% interval. This is because the confidence interval is formulated using the Z/t level, which increases when you look for an interval of greater confidence. For example, the critical Z-value for a confidence interval of 95% is 1.96, but this value would be 2.58 for a 99% confidence interval. Because this critical value is multiplied by the standard error to form the confidence interval, we can expect the interval for 99% confidence to be wider. This is intuitive, because increasing the size of a given region naturally increases our confidence that the mean lies within this specified region/location. 


# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), 
                        error = FALSE)
```


```{r}
#prepare the dataset

#calculate the margin
approval_polllist$enddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)
new_approval <- approval_polllist %>% 
  filter(subgroup=="Voters") %>% 
  mutate(net_approve = approve - disapprove, year = year(enddate), 
         week = week(enddate))

glimpse(new_approval)

```
```{r}
#calculate the CI for average approval margin

margin_ci <- new_approval %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(avg_approval_margin = mean(net_approve),
            sd_margin = sd(net_approve, na.rm=TRUE),
            count_margin = n(),
            se_margin = sd_margin / sqrt(count_margin),
            ci_margin_up = avg_approval_margin + qt(.975, count_margin-1)*se_margin ,
            ci_margin_dw = avg_approval_margin - qt(.975, count_margin-1)*se_margin
            )

glimpse(margin_ci)
```

```{r}
#plot the for average approval margin
margin_ci %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ci_margin_up, ymax = ci_margin_dw), fill="grey", 
              alpha = 0.5)+

  theme_minimal()+
  NULL



```



## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 6` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

```{r}
#calculate the week4 and week5 confidence intervals
margin_ci_comparison <- new_approval %>% 
  filter(week==6 | week==25) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(avg_approval_margin = mean(net_approve),
            sd_margin = sd(net_approve, na.rm=TRUE),
            count_margin = n(),
            se_margin = sd_margin / sqrt(count_margin),
            ci_margin_up = avg_approval_margin + qt(.975, count_margin-1)*se_margin ,
            ci_margin_dw = avg_approval_margin - qt(.975, count_margin-1)*se_margin
            )

#plot the confidence intervals
margin_ci_comparison %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=avg_approval_margin, y=week, color=week))+
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=ci_margin_dw,xmax=ci_margin_up))+
  geom_point(aes(x=avg_approval_margin, y=week), size=6)+
  labs(title="Comparison of confidence intervals for week4 and week 25",
       x = "Average approval margin", 
       y = "Week")
  

#We can see that the average approval margin for week4 is larger than that in week25. However, the confidence interval in week4 [6.12, 19.4] and week25 [6.36, 11.5] overlap. Therefore, based on the confidence interval graphs generated below, we cannot tell if on average, Biden has significantly lower approval margin in week25 than that in week4.
```


```{r}
comparison_approval <- new_approval %>% 
  filter(week==6 | week==25)

t.test(net_approve ~ week, data = comparison_approval)
#Based on the result below, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. 

```
# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on

* Left Join makes the most sense among the different types of join operations like outer joins - left, right, and full. This is because a left join operation (regardless of there being a match) preserves the original observations, especially when one looks up additional data from another table. Since, we are working with 3 dataframes, while mapping the year and date column with different start/end time frames, it is essential to preserve the original observations in each dataframe. 

```{r}
# tidying HIV data - hiv and life_expectancy dataframes - using pivot_longer() 
#+ remving NA values
hiv1 <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(2:34, names_to = "year", values_to = "Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49") %>% 
  drop_na()
skim(hiv1)
life_expectancy_1 <- life_expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(2:302, names_to = "year", values_to = "Life_Expectancy") %>% 
  drop_na()
skim(life_expectancy_1)
```

```{r}
#Removing NA values in worldbank_data
worldbank_data_1 <- worldbank_data %>%
  drop_na()
skim(worldbank_data_1)
```


```{r}
#Left Join of life_expectancy_1 (tidied life_expectancy) and hiv1 (tidied hiv) dataframes 
join_1 <- left_join(life_expectancy_1, hiv1, by = c("country"="country", 
                                                    "year"="year"))
# Converting datatype of column (year) from character type to numeric type
join_1$year = as.numeric(join_1$year)
```

```{r}
#Left Join of join_1 (left join of hiv1 and life_expectancy_1 dataframes) 
# and worldbank_data dataframes
join_2 <- left_join(join_1, worldbank_data_1, by = c("country"="country", 
                                                     "year"="date"))
```

```{r}

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

* Based on the scatterplot with a smoothing line, it seems like region plays a role in the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy. HIV Prevalence is depicted through the percentage of HIV cases in the age group 15-49 years. In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a definite pattern of a negative slope which implies that as HIV prevalence increases, there is a decrease in Life Expectancy. In Latin America too, there is a negative slope implying an inverse relationship between HIV prevalence and Life Expectancy. However, there is more variability in the plot for Sub-Saharan Africa as compared to Latin America.

```{r}
#Scatterplot for Life Expectancy vs. HIV prevalence 
ggplot(join_3, aes(x = Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49, y = Life_Expectancy)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ region) +
    labs(title = "Relationship between HIV Prevalence and Life Expectancy", 
         x = "HIV Prevalence",
         y = "Life Expectancy")
```

2. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

* Based on the scatterplot with a smoothing line, it seems like facetting by region solidifies the belief that all regions depict an inverse relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita. In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, as the fertility rate increases, the GDP per capita decreases. The inverse relationship between the two variables demonstrates the connection between fertility choices and economic considerations. In general, developing or low-income countries tend to have higher levels of fertility than their developed counterparts for several reasons such as infant mortality, lack of access to contraceptives, generally lower levels of female education, etc.


```{r}
ggplot(join_3, aes(x = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN, y = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.5) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ region) +
    labs(title = "Relationship between Fertility Rate and GDP per capita", 
         x = "Fertility Rate",
         y = "GDP per capita")+
  NULL
```

3. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
Region 'Sub-Saharan Africa' has the most observations with missing HIV data. This is followed by Europe & Central Asia with the 2nd most observations with missing HIV data.

```{r}
#Tidying hiv dataframe
tidy_hiv <- hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:34, names_to="year", values_to = "Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49")
#Left joining tidy_hiv and countries dataframes
joined_hiv_countries <- left_join(tidy_hiv, countries, "country"= "country")
joined_hiv_countries
```
```{r}
# Determining NA values in joined_hiv_countries dataframe
joined_hiv_countries %>%
  filter(!is.na(region)) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(missing_hiv_values=sum(is.na(Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49))) %>%
  mutate(
    region=fct_reorder(region,-missing_hiv_values)) %>%
# Plotting Bar Chart of Region Specific Missing HIV Data in Descending Order
  ggplot(aes(x=region,y=missing_hiv_values))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title="Bar Chart of Region Specific Missing HIV Data in Descending Order",
    x= "Region",
    y= "Missing NA values in HIV data"
  )
```
4. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

mortality <- join_3 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(minimum_year=min(year), maximum_year=max(year))
mortality
```

```{r}

# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), 
                        error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

* According to the above graph, most of the months are of a right skewed distribution while May and June are close to a normal distribution. Being right skewed means that the average bike rental value is smaller than that of which distribution is normal. During summer, it is both predicted that bike rentals go up, and this explains the observation for May and June in this graph. It can also be seen that for the lower hire counts, their frequencies are very low. This indicates that bike rental was so popular that the very few low hire counts were observed.

* For year 2020, the pandemic obviously had heavily struck the bike rental industry. Overall, the frequency of renting a bike has decreased significantly compared to the other years. However, it is interesting to find that for the lower hire counts in May and June, their frequency increased in 2020 with regard to previous years. As it gets less popular for people to go out and rent bikes, the lower hire counts would appear more frequently than before. In fact, all the plots for 2020 are more right skewed than they were in the other years, as the data set shifted to lower hire counts due to the pandemic.

* Reproduce the following two graphs

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

* We will use the mean to calculate our expected rentals. As the distributions are mostly right-skewed, the median will be smaller than the mean and it will not be an accurate representation of the data group.


First, we take a glimpse of the dataset.
```{r}
glimpse(bike)
```

Then we look at the data if there's missing values.
```{r}
skim(bike)
#We can see that there are no missing values.
