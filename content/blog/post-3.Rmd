# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

## Load the data

First, we will examine the dataset.

```{r}
glimpse(yrbss)
```


```{r}
skimr::skim(yrbss)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

From the glimpse function used in the chunk above, we can see there are 1004 missing values from the weight category.

```{r}
yrbss %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight)) +
  geom_histogram(height = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Weight distribution", y="Count", x="Weight (kg)" )+
  NULL

favstats(~weight, data=yrbss)
```


Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. 

```{r, mutate_and_count}
#reuse code from snap_insta
yrbss_new <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >=3, 'yes',
                                    'no'))

glimpse(yrbss_new)
```

```{r}
yrbss_prop <- yrbss_new %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop=count/sum(count))
  
glimpse(yrbss_prop)
```

Provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week

```{r}
ci_yrbss_prop <- yrbss_new %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            count_weight = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight / sqrt(count_weight),
            ci_weight_up = mean_weight + qt(.975, count_weight-1)*se_weight ,
            ci_weight_dw = mean_weight - qt(.975, count_weight-1)*se_weight 
            )  

ci_yrbss_prop
```
  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. 

```{r, boxplot}
yrbss_new %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = 'Relationship between weight and excercising more than 3 times a week', x = 'Count of physical_3plus', y = 'Weight' )+
  NULL
```

* We would expect the kids which are physically active for 3 or more hours a week to weigh less on average than those who exercise less. This is the result we expect because as they are more physically active they consume more calories and so should weigh less. It appears that kids who do exercise tend to weigh more, the opposite of our prediction.
There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. 

## Confidence Interval


```{r, ci_using_formulas}
ci_using_formulas <- yrbss_new %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = T),
            median_weight = median(weight, na.rm = T),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = T),
            count = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            weight_low = mean_weight - margin_of_error,
            weight_high = mean_weight + margin_of_error
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))

ci_using_formulas
```

## Hypothesis test with formula

$H _0: \overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2 = 0\ vs.\ H_1: \overline{x}_1-\overline{x}_2 \neq 0$

```{r, t_test_using_R}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss_new)
```


## Hypothesis test with `infer`


```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss_new %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

obs_diff
```



```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss_new %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

null_dist

```

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title = "Distribution for the null hypothesis", x = "Stat",y = "Count")+
  NULL

```


To see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`

```{r}

obs_stat <- obs_diff %>% 
  pull() %>% 
  round(2)

obs_stat
```

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors


$H_0: \mu_A - \mu_B = 0$
$H_1 : \mu_A - \mu_B \neq 0$

* t-stat is equal to 3 and p-value is equal to 0.01. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that we are 95% confident that movies of Stephen Spielberg have higher average ratings than those of Tim Burton.

Load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data1", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```


```{r}
#calculate the week4 and week5 confidence intervals
rating_comparison <- movies %>% 
  filter(director=="Steven Spielberg" | director=="Tim Burton") %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE),
            count_rating = n(),
            se_rating = sd_rating / sqrt(count_rating),
            ci_rating_up = avg_rating + qt(.975, count_rating-1)*se_rating,
            ci_rating_dw = avg_rating - qt(.975, count_rating-1)*se_rating
            )

#plot the confidence intervals
rating_comparison %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=avg_rating, y=director, color=director))+
    geom_rect(fill="grey",alpha=0.5, color = "grey",
            aes(xmin=max(ci_rating_dw),
                xmax=min(ci_rating_up),
                ymin=-Inf,
                ymax=Inf))+

  labs(title="Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x = "Mean IMDB Rating")

```
```{r}
#calculate via t-test
comparison_rating <- movies %>% 
  filter(director=="Steven Spielberg" | director=="Tim Burton")

t.test(rating ~ director, data = comparison_rating)
```


```{r}

#calculate the observed difference
observed_difference <- comparison_rating %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means")

#calculate the p-value of the differences

  get_pvalue(obs_stat=observed_difference, direction="both")
```

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data1", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?


```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

salary_gender <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise (mean = mean(salary), SD = sd(salary), sample_size = n()) %>% 
  mutate(se = sqrt(SD^2/sample_size), t_value = qt(p=.05/2, df=sample_size-1, lower.tail=FALSE),
         margin_of_error = t_value*se, salary_low = mean-t_value*se, salary_high = mean+t_value*se)

salary_gender
```

* The 95% confidence interval for female is from 61486 to 67599, while that for male is from 70088 to 76490. Since their confidence intervals do not have any overlap, it can be concluded that the null hypothesis can be rejected. There is a significant difference in the mean of salary for female and male.

Run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. 

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)

salary_gender_boot <- omega %>% 
  # Specify the variable of interest "salary" and group by gender
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  
  # Hypothesize a null of no (or zero) difference
  hypothesize (null = "independence") %>% 
  
  # Generate a bunch of simualted samples
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  
  # Find the mean diffference of each sample
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("female", "male"))


# Select the low and high endpoint from the formula-calculated CIs
formula_ci <- salary_gender %>%
  select(salary_low,salary_high)

# Generate 95% percentile of the difference in the two genders' salaries from the bootstrap data
percentile_ci <- salary_gender_boot %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

percentile_ci

observed_difference <- salary_gender$mean[1]-salary_gender$mean[2]

visualize(salary_gender_boot) + 
  annotate("rect", xmin=-Inf, xmax=observed_difference, ymin=0, ymax=Inf, alpha=0.3, fill = "pink") +
  annotate("rect", xmin=-observed_difference, xmax=Inf, ymin=0, ymax=Inf, alpha=0.3, fill  = "pink") +
  #shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci,fill = "khaki")+
  labs(title='Differences in Female and Male Mean Salary in a world where there is no difference', 
       subtitle = "Observed difference marked in red",
       x = "Mean (female salary - male salary)", y = "Count")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = observed_difference, colour = "red", linetype="solid", size=1.2)+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
  
```

```{r,salary_gender_p}

salary_gender_boot %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = observed_difference, direction = "both")

```


* With bootstrap, the confidence interval for the difference in the two genders' salary is constructed, while in the null world. As a result, this CI does not include the observed difference in real world, which means that the null hypothesis should be rejected. There is a significant difference in the two genders' salaries.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?


```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```
```{r}

t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)
```

* The t-stat value is -5, which has a larger absolute value than 1.96, indicating that there is a significant difference in the two genders' experience.



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
salary_exp <- omega %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = experience, y = salary))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Relationship between salary and number of years of experience", x = "Year(s) of experience",y = "Salary")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

salary_exp

```

## Check correlations between the data


```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```


* Generally, the distribution of years of experience for male is more widely distributed than female in the scatter plot. There is also more female than male at 0 year of experience, and there is no female with more than 30 years of experience. Overall, there is a positive relation between experience and salary. It can be seen in the gender - experience box plot that male has a higher mean value for years of experience than female, and in the gender - salary box plot male also has a higher mean salary, which is predicted. However, the difference in mean salary is smaller than that in mean experience. This indicate that salary is less likely to be dependent on gender. Moreover, gender has even narrowed the gap between the difference in the two genders' experience. While there is no female within the 95% CI that has a higher experience level than male in their 95% CI, the CI for salaries do overlap.
